# WARNING: If you don't want to spend time on digging through and understanding (just basics) on how this set of CC's works, don't use it.
So, this collection of CC's is an economy with a huge amount of modifiable ends. It's left open ended to let you decide how you want it.
## Highlights
- Main balance in one user key. Generic leaderboards, balance and inventory commands.
- Dashboard for bank related information in one user key. Bank provides x interest daily. x is modifiable.
- Inventory in one user key. Items and counts get stored.
- `;con` and `;cave` commands that provide random money or deducts it. Modifiable cooldowns, quantities and replies.
- `;work` which provides 1 out of 4 activities. Cooldowns can be modified.
- `;shop` with economy related items. Stock providable via update. `;item` provides information on an item. __Item restock has not been tested.__
- `;buy` and `;give` are double verification commands. They are double - checked before transactions.
- `;configadd` sets up replies for `;con` and `;cave` and sets up shop items. __RESTRICT THIS TO ADMIN ONLY.__
- `;use` uses a said item. 3 default actions on the use of an item are already provided with a placeholder. __Main modifiable CC__
- `;help` just provides help. __The reaction handler is NOT tested.__
# Comments.
This is just a prefab for any huge economy you might want to create with Yagpdb. Highly open-ended and up to you to decide. The code can be buggy, so don't come after me. 
Hopefully this helped you. 
Have a good day!
